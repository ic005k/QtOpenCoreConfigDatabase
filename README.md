您可以在此分享OpenCore Config.plist [这里](https://github.com/ic005k/QtOpenCoreConfigDatabase/issues).

OC的难点在于Config.plist，所以请大家踊跃分享自己的Config.plist文件，旨在帮助新手快速进入状态，至于后面的完善还是要靠自己。但是您的分享会帮助到很多人，特别是那些使用OC引导而无法进入安装状态的人。
让我们一起让OC变得更容易，感谢！


You can share the OpenCore Config.plist [here](https://github.com/ic005k/QtOpenCoreConfigDatabase/issues).

The hard part of OC is Config.plist, so please feel free to share your own Config.plist file, aiming to help newbies to get into the state quickly, as for the perfection later on or on your own. But your sharing will help a lot of people, especially those who use OC boot and can't get into the installation state.
Let's make OC easier together, thanks!
